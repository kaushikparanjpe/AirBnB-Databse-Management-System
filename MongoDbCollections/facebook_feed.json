A call to AirBNB yielded no help, other than \u201ccheck your email for comparable locations\u201d \u2013 they were not even close to comparable. We rebooked with another person, and lo and behold she canceled on us too. She even had the gall to try to get us to cancel for her, so she didn\u2019t pay a fee, which would have cost us a fee. By this time there was such limited availability We ended up booking at a place that was subpar, and more expensive than if we would have just booked through the Stowe resort instead of AirBNB - and the resort would have stood by our booking. We are now very unlikely to use AirBNB again \u2013 especially with how dismissive the staff on the phone were when I called back to say we were canceled on AGAIN \u2013 and we will be telling the story to all of our friends and family to warn them that it is not very secure to use AirBNB, and that they do not stand behind their customers booking units, only those who rent them out.

After years of great Airbnb experiences, we've just had our first truly awful one and are hoping you can help make it better.  Here's the story: \\n\\nOn Friday afternoon we arrived at our place in Old Montreal, dropped our bags and left to the explore the city. It looked a bit grimy but we figured we could live with it. However, when we got home at night, we realized that our blanket was dirty and smelled of body odour and meat sweat. We checked Airbnb's policy and it says you have 24 hours to lodge a complaint - it was late and we have a child who needed to sleep, so we decided to suck it up and deal with it in the morning. The next morning we messaged our host - in addition to the dirty blanket, we had only received 2 towels and 2 pillows instead of 3. Because we had to replace the dirty linens with the only spare blanket, we didn't have enough bedding to make up the promised spare mattress, so were reduced to 1 bed for the whole family, instead of the 2 we expected. \\n\\nOur host got back to us and admitted he had a new assistant and that she didn't know she had to wash the blankets- at that point we figured we'd get our money back and be able to leave because the host has acknowledged that the amenities we paid for have not been provided, ie clean linens and two beds. But when we asked Airbnb for a refund on the phone, we were treated quite rudely (PM me and I'll tell you the name of the agent we spoke with). There's a lot more to this story, but the essence is this: our host admitted that the blankets were dirty, and Airbnb refused to give us a full refund (we got a 50% refund on the first night, but still have to pay the cleaning fee, taxes, booking fee, etc. We wanted to leave, but the Airbnb customer service agent told us we could leave but would have to pay the cancellation fee, which is full price for the remaining night and that the owner had fixed the problem by sending an assistant to clean the blanket and give us an extra towel and pillow, even though the assistant didn\u2019t clean anything else). I sent these pictures to your customer service department and the agent said I must be overly anxious and have high cleaning standards.  So we stayed a second night in this filthy apartment. Is this really the standard of hygiene that Airbnb supports? I've posted these pictures on my personal Facebook page (and tagged Airbnb) and nearly everyone there says a full refund is the only appropriate response, and that we definitely should've been able to cancel the second night without penalty.", "feed__data__id": "324826532457_10156355588442458", "feed__data__shares__count": 146, "feed_data_likes": 42, "feed_data_comments": 32}, {"page_name": "Airbnb", "page_id": 324826532457, "feed__data__created_time": "2018-04-02T07:25:10+0000", "feed__data__message": "It has now been 2 weeks since there is a lock on my account.

That heart shape is what the color of the chair *should have been* - and even then that wasn\u2019t the actual color. The actual color was white.

Mais le faux Alex (ce n\u2019est pas une femme mais bien un homme) a pr\u00e9tendu \u00ab ne pas en avoir pour l\u2019instant \u00bb\u2026  Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s \u00eatre entr\u00e9es dans l\u2019appartement que nous avons compris pourquoi.\\nNous avons bel et bien eu une chambre priv\u00e9e avec salle de bain priv\u00e9e mais :\\n\u2022 C\u2019\u00e9tait spartiate : un lit et une t\u00e9l\u00e9vision.  Pas de table ni de lampe d\u2019appoint, pas de commode, pas de chaise, pas de sofa comme sur la photo.\\n\u2022 On a d\u00fb demander le lit gonflable, un lit gonflable qui sortait d\u2019une pile dans le salon o\u00f9 la propret\u00e9 \u00e9tait vraiment douteuse.\\n\u2022 \u00c7a sentait le parfum d\u2019ambiance de mauvaise qualit\u00e9, dans la chambre, comme si on voulait camoufler des odeurs.\\n\u2022 Le bain et l\u2019\u00e9vier n\u2019\u00e9taient pas propres, le miroir non plus.\\n\u2022 On a re\u00e7u pour toutes serviettes 5 d\u00e9barbouillettes et une serviette \u00e0 mains.\\n\u2022 Les stores occultants \u00e9taient d\u00e9fectueux.\\n\u2022 Le balcon \u00e9tait encombr\u00e9 des effets personnels appartenant \u00e0 d\u2019autres locataires (Alex a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable des all\u00e9es et venues des personnes dans l\u2019appartement!).\\n\u2022 La porte de la chambre ne se barrait que de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur.  Donc on ne pouvait barrer notre chambre lorsque nous aurions voulu quitt\u00e9.  Qui plus est, la porte de l\u2019appartement \u00e9tait toujours d\u00e9barr\u00e9e.  Alex ne nous a fourni qu\u2019une cl\u00e9 de l\u2019immeuble, pas celle de l\u2019appartement, sous pr\u00e9texte qu\u2019il y a avait toujours du monde dans l\u2019appartement, qu\u2019il nous a dit!   On n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 faire un et un font deux : porte d\u2019appartement et porte de chambre d\u00e9barr\u00e9es, on peut se faire voler.\\nQuand nous avons confront\u00e9 Alex avec notre insatisfaction, il s\u2019est confondu en excuses simul\u00e9es et il a dit qu\u2019il nous fournirait le matelas et d\u2019autres serviettes.  Le matelas, OK, les serviettes, on oublie \u00e7a, on ne les a jamais re\u00e7ues.  Pour ce qui est de nos remarques sur l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019appartement, il a r\u00e9pondu que nous avions lou\u00e9 une chambre faisant fi du fait que nous avions acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la cuisine dans un environnement repoussant!\\nL\u2019appartement en question.\\n\u2022 Il y avait 4 ou 5 locataires dans le salon et la cuisine quand nous sommes arriv\u00e9es, seules, puisqu\u2019Alex ne nous a pas accompagn\u00e9es.  Tous des locataires de passage qui, semble-t-il, faisaient du \u00ab couch surfing \u00bb (canap\u00e9s et moult lits gonflables).\\n\u2022 Les lieux \u00e9taient sales et naus\u00e9abonds.\\n\u2022 La cuisine et le frigo aussi.\\n\u2022 Pas de cafeti\u00e8re.  Pas de verres.  Nous n\u2019avons pu profiter que de deux tasses.\\n\u2022 Au r\u00e9veil, six personnes dans la noirceur du salon, toutes dormant dans un vrai fouillis.\\nNous avons assez voyag\u00e9 de par le monde (avec Airbnb souvent) pour savoir ce \u00e0 quoi s\u2019attendre en louant une chambre \u00e0 123$CAD (+ frais) \u00e0 Hollywood.  Nous ne nous attendions pas au Ritz Carleton.  Mais nous n\u2019acceptons pas le fait d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 h\u00e9berg\u00e9es dans un appartement aux allures d\u2019auberge de jeunesse d\u2019une malpropret\u00e9 certaine.\\nAu chapitre des communications :\\n\u2022 Alex m\u2019a fait r\u00e9p\u00e9ter plein de trucs avant la prise de possession, pendant que j\u2019\u00e9tais \u00e0 Venice.  Il avait pourtant toutes les infos dans nos \u00e9changes Airbnb.\\n\u2022 J\u2019ai d\u00fb insister pour qu\u2019il prenne les bagages, le matin de la location et tel qu\u2019entendu, car il ne croyait plus \u00eatre disponible!\\n\u2022 Alex m\u2019a donc donn\u00e9 rendez-vous pour prendre nos bagages.  Pas devant l\u2019appartement, l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rue.  Pas lui, un locataire r\u00e9veill\u00e9 \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re minute.  En retard.\\n\u2022 Le soir de la location, toujours de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rue.  \u00c0 travers ses infos confuses, il nous demande de r\u00e9pondre que nous sommes \u00ab des tantes de la famille \u00bb si on nous questionne dans ou en dehors de l\u2019appartement.\\nAlex a bien essay\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre courtois en pr\u00e9textant qu\u2019il ne nous voulait pas insatisfaites.  Il a m\u00eame ramass\u00e9 succinctement la cuisine et pass\u00e9 l\u2019aspirateur sur le plancher sale de la cuisine.  Mais \u00e7a n\u2019a rien arrang\u00e9.\\nNous avons d\u00fb dormir l\u00e0, la premi\u00e8re nuit, car nous sommes arriv\u00e9es \u00e0 19h45 (comme Alex l\u2019avait demand\u00e9), trop tard pour trouver quelque chose \u00e0 un prix raisonnable.  J\u2019ai pourtant cherch\u00e9 pendant 3 heures.  J\u2019ai tout de m\u00eame trouv\u00e9 pour le lendemain et pour 2 nuits, \u00e0 un prix sup\u00e9rieur que celui que j\u2019avais pay\u00e9 via Airbnb.  Il ne restait presque rien \u00e0 Hollywood, \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re minute comme \u00e7a.\\nPour toutes ces raisons et pour le fait d\u2019offrir une location sous de fausses repr\u00e9sentations, nous demandons un remboursement complet.\\nJe joins ici quelques photos.  Si vous avez besoin du t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019amie qui m\u2019accompagnait ou si vous avez des questions, n\u2019h\u00e9sitez pas.\\nEnfin, je crois qu\u2019Alex n\u2019a pas droit de louer l\u2019appartement car jamais, il ne nous a rencontr\u00e9es au pied de l\u2019immeuble; qui plus est, il n\u2019y est pas rentr\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps que nous et nous a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 de nous identifier comme \u00ab tantes de la famille \u00bb.  D\u2019ailleurs, j\u2019ai \u00e9crit au syndic de copropri\u00e9t\u00e9s pour savoir ce qu\u2019il en \u00e9tait.\\nMerci de votre attention et de votre collaboration.\\nDominique Bernier", "feed__data__id": NaN, "feed__data__shares__count": 4357, "feed_data_likes": 578, "feed_data_comments": 26}, {"page_name": "Airbnb", "page_id": 324826532457, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-06-19T13:50:59+0000", "feed__data__message": "We are up and running !

They charged me 5k even though I cancelled the trip right after.

I am new to AirBNB as of tonight- just finished my listing.  I have to say I am a bit unsure about it all as there is no phone number to contact an actual live person if needed for questions, etc.  I also cannot find a way to attach a PDF rental contract/agreement to any booking and am not satisfied with the cancellation and refund policies they offer.  If I am going to attach a rental contract/agreement to any booking, I would have to totally modify my contract/agreement to work with their parameters.  Anyone have any thoughts, recommendations to share about any of these issues?  Been with VRBO and HomeAway for 25 years and trying to broaden my exposure, but at least those companies have a real live person to speak with for simplicity in getting any answers, if nothing else.

In August i rented a place in Nebraska. The first night the owner showed up at almost midnight drunk and high to \u201cmeet\u201d us. He was so intoxicated i could smell him from 5 feet away and you could clearly tell he was on drugs. Teeth chattering, jaw clenching, weird physical movements in general. The first night i noticed cameras on the inside of the apartment looking into the apartment. I turned in around to face the outside. After the trip everything was fine and i went about my life. Approximately a week after i left i got a text from him saying something along the lines of are you going to pay the extra 25$ a night for your guest being there or am i gonna go to Airbnb. I replied saying he was only there to hang out etc. he them stated he had cameras and \u201ceverything\u201d is on video. His message was very incriminating and you could tell he was trying to blackmail me. So i called Airbnb immediately and informed them of this situation. After calling about 5 times and emailing them 10 sending in all evidence. They still have not resolved this matter not even a phone call. I find this to be a huge security and privacy issue. I also filed a cc dispute to only have them fight it and somehow win. Tell me how they have time to fight a money issue but no time to fix a privacy issue. I contacted a lawyer and this will be an ongoing matter. I really hope they aren\u2019t renting this guys home still. If they are i can\u2019t tell you how much to stay away from this company. They have 0 regards for privacy and safety and only care about  what\u2019s in your wallet. I will be taking every measure possible to share my story with everyone in hopes they realize spending the extra money on a hotel is well worth it.", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1943050889280550", "feed__data__shares__count": 11, "feed_data_likes": 11, "feed_data_comments": 11}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-11-16T11:01:14+0000", "feed__data__message": "Lessons from a Pro: Tips to Make Your Airbnb More Appealing - ZING Blog by Quicken Loans", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1942524695999836", "feed__data__shares__count": 3, "feed_data_likes": 11, "feed_data_comments": 11}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-11-16T03:37:08+0000", "feed__data__message": "Hey guys - just wanted to share that the registration for our Masterclass is open now until Friday.

Once again, never told me about the animal during booking. \\n\\nI contacted Airbnb, and in fact he is correct. \\n\\nGuests do not need to disclose a service animal and they do not need to provide any proof that the animal is actually a service animal. So literally every new set of guests that come into your house could, in theory, bring an animal with them.\\n\\nHmmmmmmm", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1931648810420758", "feed__data__shares__count": 11, "feed_data_likes": 11, "feed_data_comments": 1}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-10-19T18:46:22+0000", "feed__data__message": "Miami dade Air bnb host\\n", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1931406467111659", "feed__data__shares__count": 11, "feed_data_likes": 11, "feed_data_comments": 11}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-10-18T13:48:49+0000", "feed__data__message": "Airbnb does not protect or help either the guest or the host.

I've been hosting for a while now and I have always been a general brand ambassador however as a host I have found it increasingly difficult dealing with Airbnb to reach resolutions on issues.\\nMost recently I have had plumbing issues which resulted in water leaking through the bathroom and into the apartment below. As the plumbing had to be fixed, no running water in the apartments I had to make a cancellation on a booking as the guests wouldn't be able to have a shower and use water, I advised the guests and they were fine and appreciated the notice and explanation, no running water is a pretty important aspect to a stay I would think and Airbnb's response to when I used their customer service to reverse cancellation fees applied due to extenuating circumstances was 'no, running water is not deemed as a priority issue'....uuummmm the guests can't shower, this is kind of a big deal! Imagine guests coming to stay, advising them running water, they can't shower, I feel if the guests contacted Airbnb, they would have viewed this as a significant issue.\\nI mean, YOU CANT SHOWER! I wouldn't feel right having someone stay, charging them normally rates and not having access to running water!!\\nAs the issue is being resolved by my landlord, the request to Airbnb to reverse the cancellation from my profile and reverse cancellation charges I was asked to supply an invoice in a 'letterhead' from the company fixing the issue detailing the work required and the cost or a letter from my landlord advising the above. \\n\\nNow, let's be real here, I'm not sure about others but I doubt there are any hosts who's landlord is aware they host. The evidence I provided showing the exchange in text regarding the damage with the landlord, the occupants in the apartment below effected and the photos of the damage from the water issue was apparently not enough, the logic in now losing out on superhost status, \u20ac700 in income and a \u20ac150 cancellation still wasn't enough. I mean, I didn't cancel because I thought it be hilarious to lose out on income, get charged a cancellation fee, have a cancellation appear on my profile and remove myself from superhost status!\\nAs a host I have come to realise that with Airbnb there is no assistance and maybe I have just been unlucky but as a brand and on paper, Airbnb is awesome, in theory and practice, it's difficult, frustrating and there is no backup from Airbnb. \\nThe security of having peace of mind while having people in your home and while hosting is merely a Moto from Airbnb.\\nAirbnb's resolution centre is a minefield to navigate trough. The more people I have spoken to about hosting issue the more I hear of difficulties hosts have trying to resolve. \\nIf anyone is considering hosting, just realise and consider that you are on your own. I'm sure there have been success's with other hosts dealing with issues and that's great but my experience has been pretty difficult lengthy, frustrating and so have others....you've a great brand Airbnb, the notion of hosting is awesome, meeting different people is pretty great and I have...Until something goes wrong, then, it removes the positive aspects to all of this.", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1888077084777931", "feed__data__shares__count": 11, "feed_data_likes": 9, "feed_data_comments": 9}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-06-30T19:00:58+0000", "feed__data__message": "Regulations can sometimes drive up the number of Airbnb listings of a city.", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1887853424800297", "feed__data__shares__count": 11, "feed_data_likes": 9, "feed_data_comments": 9}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-06-30T10:00:20+0000", "feed__data__message": "Airbnb turning traditional business on its head", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1887658181486488", "feed__data__shares__count": 11, "feed_data_likes": 9, "feed_data_comments": 9}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-06-30T03:11:22+0000", "feed__data__message": "A simple way to increase your bookings.

However, prior to launching I have been asking Airbnb Hosts for their feedback.\\n\\nI have met several Melbourne based Hosts for coffee over the past few weeks to discuss my idea and to gauge their feedback. The people I am reaching out to are Hosts who I believe seem dedicated to hosting and who understand what it takes to provide a great guest experience.\\n\\nThe product and service I am launching is a convenient solution to improve the hosting experience. It will empower Hosts to enhance guest experience through a unique offering \u2013 a subscription based service which provides mini \u2018hotel essentials\u2019 for you to provide your guests.\\n\\nI have put together a short 2-3 minute survey and would love if you could help me out by completing it. All Hosts who complete the survey will get their first month of Airbnb Host Essentials on me and also go into the draw to win a $200AUD pre-paid Visa card!\\n\\nHost link:  https://goo.gl/forms/BoC8qhL7S8DBpHoA3 \\n\\nFeel free to share the link with your Airbnb Host network \u2013 the more feedback we get, the better we can make the service for Airbnb Hosts (and of course, your guests)!\\n\\nIf you would like to chat with me about what I\u2019ve been up to, please reach out and contact me.

This is my first post here.  I have a big problem.  I have been an active AirBnB member for about 5 years, and have been a hist for 4 months.  I have unfortunately had to make two cancellations on my listing, before I sorted out my calendar management.  All of my reviews personally and of my listing have been excellent. I made my second cancellation (of a one-night booking in August 2017) a few days ago.  AirBnB gave me warnings and charged me $50.  Fair enough.  I woke in the middle of last night to see another booking request.  When I responded I found that my listing had been de-activated.  THIS IS WHERE THINGS GET STRANGE.  I followed the link to reactivate my listing only to find that my listing has been set back to draft mode, with no calendar, pricing, rules etc.  Even the photos need to be re-done.  All of my reservations are gone, as are all of my reviews of my listing and of me personally.  This is very alarming, since I have people booked in coming weeks and months who have planned family holidays to my apartment in Croatia.  I sent an email from the Help Center.  When I received the helpdesk confirmation email it was in Italian!  I sent another email asking why my response was in Italian.  The response to that was in Italian too.  There is no way I have changed my language in my settings recently, but I looked and sure enough it was set to Italian.  I changed back to English. Can anyone shine any light on my issue??

PLEASE HELP ME !!! PLEASEHELP ME !!!  \\nPLEASE HELP ME !!! PLEASE HELP ME !!! PLEASEHELP ME !!!   \\nPLEASE HELP ME !!! PLEASE HELP ME !!! PLEASEHELP ME !!!  \\n\\nHi, I'm Francesco 28 yars old from Italy. I am writing here in Italian, I hope some people, working within the Airbnb group, can help me to solve the problems I have, without getting any response from the customer service.\\n\\nSalve, mi chiamo Francesco italiano viaggio spesso in giro per il mondo e ho il moi appartamento a Parigi, dove ormai sono residente da anni. \\n\\nAnni fa, quando il sito era agli inizi avevo creato un conto e ho anche affittato un appartamento, dopodich\u00e9 non ho pi\u00f9 utilizzato il sito finch\u00e9 non ho avuto ancora bisogno, solamente che questa volta ho effuato l'accesso con facebook ed \u00e9 stato all'ora che il sistema ha bloccato il moi conto, perch\u00e9 la mail associata al moi conto facebook era diversa da quella che avevo utilizzato quando ho fatto l'iscrizione su airbnb. Ho cercato di risolvere il problema da solo eliminando i due acxount creati. Non \u00e9 cambiato nulla, per cui ho cominciato un lunghissimo percorso con il servizio clienti Airbnb Italia ed Airbnb France ( paese in cui risiedo) per cercare di risolvere il problema. Alla fine dopo tanto tempo mi sono arreso perch\u00e9 il caso era stato chiuso e gli account creati a moi nome erano stati eliminati. Da allora sono passati anni, ho cambiato il documento perch\u00e9 mi era scaduto, numero di telefono, ho creato un conto paypal, ed anche banca.\\n\\nLo scorso febbraio ho cambiato appartamento ed adesso vivo in uno dei luoghi pi\u00f9 desiderati della capitale francese, a soli 100 mt dalla cattedrale Notre dame e, dato che ho ricominciato a viaggiare tanto, ho pensato di poter essere accettato nella grande famiglia Airbnb\\n\\nIl tempo di sistemare il moi appartamento, comprando dei mobili, imbiancare e fare alcuni lavori che ho effettuato il moi primo viaggio con un amico a Colonia. L'appartamento che avevamo trovato era stato grazie ad un passaparola e alla fine il nostro soggiorno in Germania \u00e9 stato un vero disastro perch\u00e9 la persona che doveva ospitari ci \u00e9 incassato i soldi ed \u00e9 sparito. \\n\\nRitornato a Parigi, e spinto dai tanti amici sempre in viaggio e da tanti altri che affittano i propi appartamenti, ho deciso di sfruttare al meglio le mie risorse... un appartamento nel cuore di Parigi mi da la possibilit\u00e0 di affittarlo sempre e guadagnando tanto, mentre con i soldi dai possibili guadagni potevo spenderli per pagarmi gli altri soggiorni che comunque farei lo stesso.\\n\\nA fine aprile, ho creato un conto Airbnb direttamente con il moi facebook e la mai associata, ho effettuato tutte le procedure di sicurezza automatiche, ho creato un annuncio e l'ho pubblicato. Non avevo nessuna richiesta, ma non mi ero preoccupato, finch\u00e9 non ho iniziato a scrivere ad alcuni host per sapere se avevano delle disponibilit\u00e0 in previsione di un viaggio a Ginevra ed un altro, in gruppo, previsto a Madrid. Il sito mi diceva che non potevo contattare gli host e che dovevo chiamare il servizio assistenza clienti per il problema. Bene, li chiamai tempestivamente e fu aperto un caso da parte di un altro operatore, solo il 9 maggio, che mi ha garantito che avrebbe portato in tempi brevi alla risoluzione del problema. Da allora chiamo tutti i giorni sia in Italia che in Francia per sapere lo stato di avanzamento della procedura di verifica in corso. \\nPer accellerare e facilitare tutto, visto che ogni volta dovevo passare delle ore al telefono con operatori che ogni volta cambiavano, ho inviato una mail dove spiegavo bene tutto, inviano anche tutti i documenti in mio possesso ( passaporto, carta d'identit\u00e0, patente, carta di credito, bollette del cosumo energetico e del telefono intestate a moi nome e con il mio indirizzo, tessera sanitaria italiana, tessera sanitaria francese, ect ect....), ho anche contattato il sito per richiedere il sevizio di un fotografo che viene offerto gratuitamente, che possa autenticare il moi annuncio e con delle belle foto che possano mettere in risalto il mio appartamento che sto mettendo in affitto su Airbnb.\\nAllo stesso, tempo ho creato altri annunci su altri siti concorrenti ad Airbnb, ma che non hanno lo stesso peso nel mondo, ed ho inviato i link al servizio assistenza clienti per fare vedere che in nessun altro sito ho riscontrato gli stessi problemi e che realmente il moi appartamento \u00e9 messso in locazione. \\n\\n Da allora, in totale i casi aperti e inoltrati al dipartimento per le verifiche e la sicurezza Airbnb sono ben 3. Ma risultano essere stati \u00ab parcheggiati \u00bb perch\u00e9 ogni volta che chiamo il servizio clienti, qualsiasi operatore mi dice che non puo' fare altro che mettere la pratica al massimo stato di urgenza ed ogni volta che richiamo il nulovo operatore con cui parlo mi ridice la stessa cosa e, che non puo' dirmi con esattezza quando il problema sara preso in considerazione ed esaminato, per cui mi invita a ricontattare il servizio clienti per conoscere lo stato di avanzamento della pratica. \\nNessuno, \u00e9 stato in grado di risolvere il mio problema a distanza di tempo, o meglio nessuno a preso realmente il mio caso nelle mani perch\u00e9 ogni volta che un operatore telefonico del servizio clienti esegue la normale procedura, suppongo che essa venga automaticamente bloccata dal sistema e, la mia pratica non viene nemmeno presa in considerazione da parte del dipartimento di verifica del sito Airbnb.    \\nIl penultimo, operatore mi ha invitato a non far parte della famiglia Airbnb perch\u00e9 questa multinazionale \u00e9 privata e libera di applicate le politiche che vuole per accettare o meno sia host che viaggiatori o entrambi a fare parte di questa grande famiglia. E, che potevo benissimo continuare ad utilizzare le piattaforme concorrenziali ad Airbnb, qualora quest'ultima non avrebbe soddisfatto le mie esigenze. Di fatti propio ieri ho effettuato una prenotazione per me ad altri 4 ragazzi sul sito Booking, ho inviato copia della conferma di avveuta prenotazione ad Airbnb per mostrare l'effettiva veridicit\u00e0 di quanto dica ogni qualvolta sia entrato in contatto con l'assistenza Airbnb.\\nL'ultimo operatore con il quale ho parlato, mi ha inviatato a scrivere nella pagina facebook di Airbnb, al fine di poter trovare qualcuno che ricopra una funzione al di sopra di quella di un operatore telefonico, che prenda realmente in carico l'esaminazione del caso e porti ad una risoluzione dello stesso.

Airbnb has failed me as a host.  I had a guest who stayed at my unit for 5 days.  Once she left I found flooding and sewage backup in my washroom and another area.  I found out my female guest put down my toilet over 25 tampons and other items over the period of 5 days.  As you know, they don't go there.  Well, that caused a backup and then a semi flood in my unit.  I called an emergency plumber which removed the tampons which cost me $600 for 3.5 hours of Sunday emergency work.   Let's not even talk about damage below my hardwood.  I had to cancel the next guest and I sent photos to Airbnb as they acknowledged the issue and canceled without penalty for me (lost another $120). I then submitted a claim, with the pictures of the damage, the plumber's invoice which clearly stated that the tampons caused the damage, and even the guest herself admitted on record she did flush them all.  It took Airbnb almost 2 months of no replies to come back to me and say they will not support my claim nor give any of the damage deposit back.  They sent a lackluster email stated I had several guests after the said female left (All the guest were Males) and stated they cannot associate the damage (because it took 10 days from the invoice to go to my property manager then to me) to the female guest even though the plumbing emergency invoice if from the same day she left and that I had to cancel the next guest because of this issue.  Airbnb then said they will not speak about this matter anymore.  It took them 2 months (2months!!!) to come back to me with this response.  I have all the communication with Airbnb, even a recorded phone call with another service person who stated this shouldn't be my issue.  I highly warm you guys the issues of damage and the path to getting money for it.  Image dealing with Airbnb for issues worth thousands. I will stop being a host after this horrible customer service journey.", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1866952700223703", "feed__data__shares__count": 16, "feed_data_likes": 11, "feed_data_comments": 11}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-05-12T19:00:38+0000", "feed__data__message": "MultiBrief: Can hotels stop the growth of Airbnb?", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1865345240384449", "feed__data__shares__count": 1, "feed_data_likes": 11, "feed_data_comments": 11}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-05-12T10:00:56+0000", "feed__data__message": "For Millennial Travelers, Does Airbnb Beat Hotels?", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1865156957069944", "feed__data__shares__count": 2, "feed_data_likes": 11, "feed_data_comments": 2}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-05-11T10:00:56+0000", "feed__data__message": "Vancouver Plans More Airbnb Limits to Ease Near-Zero Home Supply", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1864720653780241", "feed__data__shares__count": 16, "feed_data_likes": 11, "feed_data_comments": 2}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-05-10T22:59:34+0000", "feed__data__message": "http://airhostsforum.com/t/how-to-craft-the-perfect-welcome-email-as-an-airbnb-host/13837?u=cyn", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1864550980463875", "feed__data__shares__count": 16, "feed_data_likes": 3, "feed_data_comments": 2}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-05-10T19:01:13+0000", "feed__data__message": "Airbnb And Hotels Need Each Other, They Just Don't Know It Yet", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1864458643806442", "feed__data__shares__count": 3, "feed_data_likes": 11, "feed_data_comments": 11}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-05-10T10:00:00+0000", "feed__data__message": "Hosts, is your airbnb in one of these cities?", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1864290880489885", "feed__data__shares__count": 1, "feed_data_likes": 8, "feed_data_comments": 11}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-05-10T03:24:16+0000", "feed__data__message": "Located in city center With free parking, your own bathroom and kitchen, view of Ljubljana castle?

And truly feel that we are getting the runaround from your department. Per the recommendation of your Air bnb customer service rep we were advised on March 16 to NOT fill out the resolution form nor to contact the guest directly for 2 reasons: the damage is estimated way over the security deposit amount and they do not speak English. When they were here we had to use Google Translate for every single question and conversation. We have been told that their guest security deposit is only $1,000 and will not come anywhere close to reimbursing us for the damages we have incurred, we are looking at around $19,000 in damages and lost rental income. We have already spoken to someone in detail about the Host Guarantee and was assured that when I forwarded my pictures and videos that would be sufficient enough to get the ball rolling.  When we spoke with Benjamin M. on the phone he assured us that the host guarantee would already be in process.

It got horribly destroyed, the visitors broke our bed, threw plates and hand-crafted decoration out of the window, stole our camera, wrote on our walls and many small things (a cooking pot, our trash can, a clothing rag, a poster, a lampion...) got damaged or missing. They had a look in all of our personal belongings and even found a credit card and used it to open two Paypal accounts. We had a damage of more than 700 Euros and much more personal time and value was wasted. \\nNow the Airbnb insurance is giving us back only 185 Euros. Why that little? Because we didn\u2019t keep the receipts for plates and trash cans\u2026 No body does! We had photos/videos of our apartment and were able to prove the damage. \\n\\nThe lesson we learned from this experience, is that you should never rent your apartment on airbnb, unless you kept the receipts of all the items you own. So you people out there with furniture and decoration, collected with love at antique at artisanal markets (who ever asked for a recipe there?), be prepared that you will we not get reimbursed when something breaks or gets stolen.\\n\\nWe will never rent out again our rooms or apartments with Airbnb. We are shocked that you don\u2019t take care of your clients. We talked to many friends and family members and they were shocked as well.

My husband and I have stayed in numerous hotels and B&Bs with very little hassle until I tried Airbnb. I did manage to upload a picture of my driving licence which was deemed insufficient evidence that I am who I say I am. There was no way I could formally cancel my request so I have inconvenienced the hosts and wasted a great deal of time. Right from the start I have been amazed that a simple thing like mentioning the precise location - even within a few miles - would be very helpful and time/saving when searching for a place to stay but you have to open each post to get an even approximate idea of its location. The website is so inferior to other methods of searching for accommodation. After reading some hosts' remarks I'm amazed anyone bothers. I certainly won't until it improves. \\nRosemary", "feed__data__id": "1468282856757358_1822285348023772", "feed__data__shares__count": 4, "feed_data_likes": 11, "feed_data_comments": 1}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Hosts", "page_id": 1468282856757350, "feed__data__created_time": "2017-02-09T00:07:55+0000", "feed__data__message": "#weaccept?

This lively neighborhood not only serves as the cultural center of Baltimore but as the home to a diverse group of residents and businesses. College students who walk to class and professionals who work here, downtown, or as far away as Washington and New York are just some of the people who take advantage of Mt. Vernon's convenient location. Singles and empty nesters who seek to avoid the monotony of the suburbs, enjoy a wide array of art, entertainment, and services just steps from their front door. Living spaces include single family Victorian row homes, carriage houses, condominiums, apartments in row homes, and several high-rises.\\n\\nHistory Mt. Vernon acquired its land and name during the 19th century when John Eager Howard and his heirs donated the highest point in Baltimore to become the site for the first memorial to George Washington. The site of the Washington Monument in Mt. Vernon Square is generally regarded as one of the most beautiful urban sites in the world. Between 1800 and 1900 Mt. Vernon was at the center of Baltimore's transformation from an insignificant harbor city to a place of prominence and wealth. This was the time when fortunes were made and great philanthropies bestowed. During the neighborhood's early history, wealthy residents including Henry and William Walters, Robert Garrett, A.S. Abell, and Theodore Marburg commissioned well-known architects such as Niernsee & Neilson, Stanford White, John Russell Pope, and Robert Mills to build the grand buildings and monuments that still grace the neighborhood.\\n\\nLinda Orlomoski's photo is of the Brexton's spiral staircase.\\n\\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/mouseski/4881572056/", "feed__data__id": "126753367445648_200189173457257", "feed__data__shares__count": 0, "feed_data_likes": 0, "feed_data_comments": 0}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Washington DC\r\n", "page_id": 126753367445648, "feed__data__created_time": "2013-02-04T14:13:13+0000", "feed__data__message": "Upcoming Opera Night at Sotto Sopra, Sunday, Feb 24th in Baltimore's historic Mount Vernon district.

Open from November 9th through March 2nd, the exhibition finds at its core the twenty hand-pulled photogravures comprising Paul Strand's seminal 1933 Mexican Portfolio. Further explorations of Mexico come from renowned photographers Edward Weston, Wayne Miller, and Aaron Siskind, among others. The collection's diverse array of artists helps capture the sociopolitical realities, local architecture, and startling landscapes of 20th century Mexico through a patently American lens.\\n\\nThe accompanying exhibit Visions of Mexico: The Photography of Hugo Brehme presents 40 works from Hugo Brehme on loan from the Throckmorton Gallery in New York City. A German \u00e9migr\u00e9 and popular postcard photographer, Brehme is perhaps best known for his hand-colored vintage photographs, which capture a Mexico as vibrant as it is timeless. Brehme's 20th century Mexico provides thoughtful contrast for La Frontera, a work-in-progress by NYC-based photographer Stefan Falke that chronicles modern-day artists along the US-Mexico border.\\n\\nhttp://www.instituteofmexicodc.org/luces.php", "feed__data__id": "126753367445648_477034032331705", "feed__data__shares__count": 0, "feed_data_likes": 0, "feed_data_comments": 0}, {"page_name": "Airbnb Washington DC\r\n", "page_id": 126753367445648, "feed__data__created_time": "2013-01-30T15:19:02+0000", "feed__data__message": "Ending Soon!\\nPOLITICAL WITS, 100 YEARS APART\\nDAUMIER AND OLIPHANT AT THE PHILLIPS\\nPhillips Collection\\n1600 21st St NW Washington, DC (Dupont Circle North Metro)\\nThursday, January 31st \\n\\nArt thumbs its nose at politics in this election-inspired gallery, featuring works by Honor\u00e9 Daumier (French, 1808\u201379) and Patrick Oliphant (Australian, b. 1935) from the museum\u2019s permanent collection.
