We booked about 5 months in advance, and had the owner cancel on us  with only a month until our trip. A call to AirBNB yielded no help, other than “check your email for comparable locations” – they were not even close to comparable. We rebooked with another person, and lo and behold she canceled on us too. She even had the gall to try to get us to cancel for her, so she didn’t pay a fee, which would have cost us a fee. By this time there was such limited availability We ended up booking at a place that was subpar, and more expensive than if we would have just booked through the Stowe resort instead of AirBNB - and the resort would have stood by our booking. We are now very unlikely to use AirBNB again – especially with how dismissive the staff on the phone were when I called back to say we were canceled on AGAIN – and we will be telling the story to all of our friends and family to warn them that it is not very secure to use AirBNB, and that they do not stand behind their customers booking units, only those who rent them out.

Here's the story: \n\nOn Friday afternoon we arrived at our place in Old Montreal, dropped our bags and left to the explore the city. It looked a bit grimy but we figured we could live with it. However, when we got home at night, we realized that our blanket was dirty and smelled of body odour and meat sweat.

The next morning we messaged our host - in addition to the dirty blanket, we had only received 2 towels and 2 pillows instead of 3. Because we had to replace the dirty linens with the only spare blanket, we didn't have enough bedding to make up the promised spare mattress, so were reduced to 1 bed for the whole family, instead of the 2 we expected. \n\nOur host got back to us and admitted he had a new assistant and that she didn't know she had to wash the blankets- at that point we figured we'd get our money back and be able to leave because the host has acknowledged that the amenities we paid for have not been provided, ie clean linens and two beds. But when we asked Airbnb for a refund on the phone, we were treated quite rudely (PM me and I'll tell you the name of the agent we spoke with). There's a lot more to this story, but the essence is this: our host admitted that the blankets were dirty, and Airbnb refused to give us a full refund (we got a 50% refund on the first night, but still have to pay the cleaning fee, taxes, booking fee, etc. We wanted to leave, but the Airbnb customer service agent told us we could leave but would have to pay the cancellation fee, which is full price for the remaining night and that the owner had fixed the problem by sending an assistant to clean the blanket and give us an extra towel and pillow, even though the assistant didn’t clean anything else). I sent these pictures to your customer service department and the agent said I must be overly anxious and have high cleaning standards.  So we stayed a second night in this filthy apartment. Is this really the standard of hygiene that Airbnb supports? I've posted these pictures on my personal Facebook page (and tagged Airbnb) and nearly everyone there says a full refund is the only appropriate response, and that we definitely should've been able to cancel the second night without penalty.",324826532457_10156355588442458,146,42,32

An Airbnb support member messaged me asking for details. After I followed up with the details, they decided not to respond to me and closed the case. I have been an Airbnb host for almost 2 years now and I have never had this much difficulty with Airbnb support. I have been calling Airbnb support night and day. I have been losing sleep over this issue. Is the Airbnb Trust and Safety team being over-worked so much that they still can not get back to me after 2 weeks? Every single support member I've talked to has absolutely no idea what is going on. \nBy the way that phone call at the top was just 1 of the many, many phone calls with Airbnb 'support'.

Radio silence. My complaint? I want a refund because the place I had booked was a health and safety hazard. It was beyond filthy. And somehow Airbnb thought that was totally okay and not worthy of a refund. They didn’t hold the funds and instead gave all of my money to the host, even though I called and expressed my concerns within HOURS of checking in. So, this chair was one of three that were as dirty if not worse. This is not filtered or doctored in ANY way. That heart shape is what the color of the chair *should have been* - and even then that wasn’t the actual color. The actual color was white. And I was expected to seat my young children on these chairs for three meals a day, plus snacks. If not there, then on the floor that was so dirty it turned my son’s feet black. If not there then the couch that was also a shade of brown black like this chair. HEADS UP PEOPLE. NEVER use Airbnb. I’m really starting to think it’s a giant scam. The place I booked? It was a super host. Someone please explain to me how someone who offers this kind of place to a person is a super host. All of the pictures for the listing show an immaculate, clean place.

When we showed up the door to the inside apartment was open, the floor was sticky, the kitchen counter had a dish rack with dishes in it, the microwave looked like something red exploded in it probably the leftover container we saw in the fridge, the shower had mold in the seams of the standup shower unit, the medicine cabinet was gross, the tv and internet didn't work, the back door deadbolt lock was gutted and there was paper towel stuffed in the hole, the bed was like sitting on the wood floor, the dresser drawers had no bottoms in them, the dirty clothes hamper had dirty socks in it, the hallway and kitchen floor was sticky. Needless to say we contacted the host who said he would have to check it out in the morning so we booked the nearest hotel and were out of there within less than 40 minutes.  This cite only let's me post 1 picture I wonder why hmmm.  The next day the host blamed everything on us claiming we spilled stuff on the floor and cooked there which we did not. So we enjoyed the rest of our trip visiting our son his wife and our grandson and when we got home filed a complaint only to be told after a week later that we needed to have file a complaint within 24 hours.

Et tout ce qu'on note, c'est que je n'ai pas essayé de m'arranger avec le propriétaire, qui ne l'est pas, j'en suis convaincue.\n\nLe 21 avril dernier, nous avons réservé la chambre des maîtres chez Alex, à Hollywood.\nL’annonce disait :\nAll amenities included.\nAPARTMENT FEATURES:\n- you get your own master bedroom with a private bathroom, closet, balcony\n- Sleeps 3 (third person can choose to sleep on living room couch or airmatress)\n- FREE WiFi\n- Central Air Conditioning and Heating\n- Hardwood Floors (carpeted bedroom/walk in closet)\n- All brand new furniture and apartment\n- Dishwasher, Microwave, Full Size Stove\n- Laundry Facilities inside the unit (modern washer and dryer)\n- Cleaned by professional maids\n- Full Kitchen\n- Extra Comfortable Mattresses, 600 thread count sheets, High Quality Comforter Sets\n- Chic and modern design\n- Stainless Steel appliances\nL’offre était bien alléchante et il y avait tout ça mais dans quel état?\nNous demandons un remboursement complet pour les raisons suivantes.\nAvant de réserver, nous avons demandé des photos supplémentaires car il n’y en a qu’une sur l’annonce d’Alex.  Mais le faux Alex (ce n’est pas une femme mais bien un homme) a prétendu « ne pas en avoir pour l’instant »…  Ce n’est qu’après être entrées dans l’appartement que nous avons compris pourquoi.\nNous avons bel et bien eu une chambre privée avec salle de bain privée mais :\n• C’était spartiate : un lit et une télévision.  Pas de table ni de lampe d’appoint, pas de commode, pas de chaise, pas de sofa comme sur la photo.\n• On a dû demander le lit gonflable, un lit gonflable qui sortait d’une pile dans le salon où la propreté était vraiment douteuse.\n• Ça sentait le parfum d’ambiance de mauvaise qualité, dans la chambre, comme si on voulait camoufler des odeurs.\n• Le bain et l’évier n’étaient pas propres, le miroir non plus.\n• On a reçu pour toutes serviettes 5 débarbouillettes et une serviette à mains.\n• Les stores occultants étaient défectueux.\n• Le balcon était encombré des effets personnels appartenant à d’autres locataires (Alex a répondu qu’il n’était pas responsable des allées et venues des personnes dans l’appartement!).\n• La porte de la chambre ne se barrait que de l’intérieur.  Donc on ne pouvait barrer notre chambre lorsque nous aurions voulu quitté.  Qui plus est, la porte de l’appartement était toujours débarrée.  Alex ne nous a fourni qu’une clé de l’immeuble, pas celle de l’appartement, sous prétexte qu’il y a avait toujours du monde dans l’appartement, qu’il nous a dit!   On n’a qu’à faire un et un font deux : porte d’appartement et porte de chambre débarrées, on peut se faire voler.\nQuand nous avons confronté Alex avec notre insatisfaction, il s’est confondu en excuses simulées et il a dit qu’il nous fournirait le matelas et d’autres serviettes.  Le matelas, OK, les serviettes, on oublie ça, on ne les a jamais reçues.  Pour ce qui est de nos remarques sur l’état de l’appartement, il a répondu que nous avions loué une chambre faisant fi du fait que nous avions accès à la cuisine dans un environnement repoussant!\nL’appartement en question.\n• Il y avait 4 ou 5 locataires dans le salon et la cuisine quand nous sommes arrivées, seules, puisqu’Alex ne nous a pas accompagnées.  Tous des locataires de passage qui, semble-t-il, faisaient du « couch surfing » (canapés et moult lits gonflables).\n• Les lieux étaient sales et nauséabonds.\n• La cuisine et le frigo aussi.\n• Pas de cafetière.  Pas de verres.  Nous n’avons pu profiter que de deux tasses.\n• Au réveil, six personnes dans la noirceur du salon, toutes dormant dans un vrai fouillis.\nNous avons assez voyagé de par le monde (avec Airbnb souvent) pour savoir ce à quoi s’attendre en louant une chambre à 123$CAD (+ frais) à Hollywood.  Nous ne nous attendions pas au Ritz Carleton.  Mais nous n’acceptons pas le fait d’avoir été hébergées dans un appartement aux allures d’auberge de jeunesse d’une malpropreté certaine.\nAu chapitre des communications :\n• Alex m’a fait répéter plein de trucs avant la prise de possession, pendant que j’étais à Venice.  Il avait pourtant toutes les infos dans nos échanges Airbnb.\n• J’ai dû insister pour qu’il prenne les bagages, le matin de la location et tel qu’entendu, car il ne croyait plus être disponible!\n• Alex m’a donc donné rendez-vous pour prendre nos bagages.  Pas devant l’appartement, l’autre côté de la rue.  Pas lui, un locataire réveillé à la dernière minute.  En retard.\n• Le soir de la location, toujours de l’autre côté de la rue.  À travers ses infos confuses, il nous demande de répondre que nous sommes « des tantes de la famille » si on nous questionne dans ou en dehors de l’appartement.\nAlex a bien essayé d’être courtois en prétextant qu’il ne nous voulait pas insatisfaites.  Il a même ramassé succinctement la cuisine et passé l’aspirateur sur le plancher sale de la cuisine.  Mais ça n’a rien arrangé.\nNous avons dû dormir là, la première nuit, car nous sommes arrivées à 19h45 (comme Alex l’avait demandé), trop tard pour trouver quelque chose à un prix raisonnable.

This beautiful 3.2 mile running and biking path connects neighborhoods from North Staten Island to South Staten Island. It was just officially opened to the public in early October 2015, so the Airbnb community helped to paint welcome signs and trail marker, and pick up trash along the trail. \n\nAfter the morning cleaning up the path, we headed to a local favorite Flagship Brewery for some craft beers and great pizza from Pier 76. \n\nIf you would like to attend a park clean up, Airbnb is headed to Van Cortland Park in the Bronx on Friday 10/16, Fort Tryon Park in Manhattan on Saturday 10/24, and McCarren Park in Brooklyn on Sunday 10/25.

In preparation for the big day, Airbnb is organizing community service events across parks in all five boroughs. \n\nLast week, over 30 New Yorkers came out on a beautiful fall day to help beautify Flushing Meadows - Corona Park in Queens. The day started with a short run, followed by an active morning raking leaves and repainting the famous reflecting pool. The team collected over 40 bags of leaves and helped revitalize the reflecting pool that hasn’t been painted in over 15 years. \n\nVolunteering at the park helped the Airbnb community members work up quite an appetite, so they headed over to Los Tres Potrillos Restaurante for some delicious guacamole, empanadas and fajitas.

I’m a struggling individual living check by check and they informed me that it was up to the host, of course the host declined to refund me so I’m shit out of luck.

Was ich auch immer fleißig getan habe.\nLaut den Kostenvoranschlägen beläuft sich der Schaden zwischen 390 € und 490 €.\n\nHeute nun bekomme ich eine Antwort, dass es sich hier ja lediglich um einen kosmetischen Schaden handele, und man nur 39 € erstatten möchte.\n\na. Hätte man das nicht schon vor 4 Wochen mitteilen können?! So dass ich nicht zu 3 Firmen rennen musste.\nb. Ist ein kosmetischer Schaden kein Schaden bzw. habt ihr kein Interesse, dass die Gastgeber auch diese Schäden ersetzt bekommen? (vgl.

I planned everything around the location, made reservations and plans with deposits. After rechecking the address the house was located roughly 20 miles from where it stated on the map and nowhere even close to the beach. I called and was laughed at by the represented who was very unprofessional, they canceled that reservation and said I'd have the  $ back in 5-15 days. So right now I have nowhere to stay and have all my money tied up until it is refunded.

My original query is still not  resolved from last week. ***Since first raising this issue, I then proceeded to receive threatening / censorship warning over my account by email about having cancelled a reservation that arose due to the glitch in your system and how to manipulate the system to work functionally, such that we then ended up posting in community help about.. *** Am I the only host who wants to resolve issues diectly with the platform operator (AirBNB), not via some sort of anonymous open forum either.....***Amazes me that you are happy to send emails to hosts and guests, but do not facilitate hosts the same simple courtesy of being able to communicate with an issue to a conventional email address.

I have to say I am a bit unsure about it all as there is no phone number to contact an actual live person if needed for questions, etc.  I also cannot find a way to attach a PDF rental contract/agreement to any booking and am not satisfied with the cancellation and refund policies they offer.  If I am going to attach a rental contract/agreement to any booking, I would have to totally modify my contract/agreement to work with their parameters.  Anyone have any thoughts, recommendations to share about any of these issues?  Been with VRBO and HomeAway for 25 years and trying to broaden my exposure, but at least those companies have a real live person to speak with for simplicity in getting any answers, if nothing else.

"Airbnb Hosts",1468282856757350,2017-11-17T17:06:48+0000,"If you plan on using Airbnb please reconsider. In August i rented a place in Nebraska. The first night the owner showed up at almost midnight drunk and high to “meet” us. He was so intoxicated i could smell him from 5 feet away and you could clearly tell he was on drugs. Teeth chattering, jaw clenching, weird physical movements in general. The first night i noticed cameras on the inside of the apartment looking into the apartment. I turned in around to face the outside. After the trip everything was fine and i went about my life. Approximately a week after i left i got a text from him saying something along the lines of are you going to pay the extra 25$ a night for your guest being there or am i gonna go to Airbnb. I replied saying he was only there to hang out etc. he them stated he had cameras and “everything” is on video. His message was very incriminating and you could tell he was trying to blackmail me. So i called Airbnb immediately and informed them of this situation. After calling about 5 times and emailing them 10 sending in all evidence. They still have not resolved this matter not even a phone call. I find this to be a huge security and privacy issue. I also filed a cc dispute to only have them fight it and somehow win. Tell me how they have time to fight a money issue but no time to fix a privacy issue. I contacted a lawyer and this will be an ongoing matter. I really hope they aren’t renting this guys home still. If they are i can’t tell you how much to stay away from this company. They have 0 regards for privacy and safety and only care about  what’s in your wallet. I will be taking every measure possible to share my story with everyone in hopes they realize spending the extra money on a hotel is well worth it.",1468282856757358_1943050889280550,11,11,11

You'd just have to list the bedding as one of your perks.\n\nI thought guests would appreciate a host who would provide naturally treated dust mite eliminating bedding.  (because dust mites have been known to make asthma and eczema conditions worse.)\n\nPlease let me know if hosts would be interested in this mutually benefiting exchange.",1468282856757358_1940166882902284,11,1,11

The guest even said there will be 8 individuals. Apparently, you don't agree to charge the guest a penny because I didn't write about extra guest fees in my listing. \n\nPlease explain to me how we cannot charge the guest when she breached my property contract? The maximum amount of guests that she could have chosen upon booking is 8. She brought 11. She paid a nightly fee for 8 people when she brought 11. She used up a lot of hydro and used my facility the way it should not be used. Since it clearly shows only 8 people can sleep in the house, why would I think of putting a fee for more then 8? I do NOT want more than 8 people to be at my house!! When the guest booked my property, she clearly said there will be 8 individuals. It's all in writing. You can legally charge her since she even admitted to it! \n\nThis case is not closed and will not be closed until there is justice done.

This is the case: we want to stay for one week in beautiful Italy. That’s why we tried to make a reservation in a AirBnb apartment. We’ve found something interesting, and not too expensive. It seemed almost too beautiful to be true…. And suddenly; it was too beautiful to be true. Our reservation was cancelled by the owner, because the prices on the AirBnB site turned out to be wrong. The apartment was more expensive. \nThen, we saw another very beautiful apartment, and a little cheaper: Happy that the first one was cancelled! We’ve made the reservation, the reservation was accepted, we paid for it, and it all seemed to go well. But…. Here we go again. It’s the same story. The reservation was cancelled, the prices on the AirBnB site turned out to be wrong and the apartment was much more expensive. So, how can we get our money back? \nAnd more important: How can we know, if we make our 3rd reservation, this time the prices on the AirBnB website are right? That the reservation will not be canceled? That we will not be homeless (or out of cash) in Italy!?\n\nSincerely, \n\nSanne en Daphne",1468282856757358_1932017260383913,11,11,11

Once again, never told me about the animal during booking. \n\nI contacted Airbnb, and in fact he is correct. \n\nGuests do not need to disclose a service animal and they do not need to provide any proof that the animal is actually a service animal.

I have also submitted a copy of Airbnb's Policy Tool Chest document, as well as additional resolutions from municipalities around the country who have developed a compromise between hosts and the community.

I've been hosting for a while now and I have always been a general brand ambassador however as a host I have found it increasingly difficult dealing with Airbnb to reach resolutions on issues.\nMost recently I have had plumbing issues which resulted in water leaking through the bathroom and into the apartment below. As the plumbing had to be fixed, no running water in the apartments I had to make a cancellation on a booking as the guests wouldn't be able to have a shower and use water, I advised the guests and they were fine and appreciated the notice and explanation, no running water is a pretty important aspect to a stay I would think and Airbnb's response to when I used their customer service to reverse cancellation fees applied due to extenuating circumstances was 'no, running water is not deemed as a priority issue'....uuummmm the guests can't shower, this is kind of a big deal! Imagine guests coming to stay, advising them running water, they can't shower, I feel if the guests contacted Airbnb, they would have viewed this as a significant issue.\nI mean, YOU CANT SHOWER! I wouldn't feel right having someone stay, charging them normally rates and not having access to running water!!\nAs the issue is being resolved by my landlord, the request to Airbnb to reverse the cancellation from my profile and reverse cancellation charges I was asked to supply an invoice in a 'letterhead' from the company fixing the issue detailing the work required and the cost or a letter from my landlord advising the above. \n\nNow, let's be real here, I'm not sure about others but I doubt there are any hosts who's landlord is aware they host. The evidence I provided showing the exchange in text regarding the damage with the landlord, the occupants in the apartment below effected and the photos of the damage from the water issue was apparently not enough, the logic in now losing out on superhost status, €700 in income and a €150 cancellation still wasn't enough. I mean, I didn't cancel because I thought it be hilarious to lose out on income, get charged a cancellation fee, have a cancellation appear on my profile and remove myself from superhost status!\nAs a host I have come to realise that with Airbnb there is no assistance and maybe I have just been unlucky but as a brand and on paper, Airbnb is awesome, in theory and practice, it's difficult, frustrating and there is no backup from Airbnb. \nThe security of having peace of mind while having people in your home and while hosting is merely a Moto from Airbnb.\nAirbnb's resolution centre is a minefield to navigate trough. The more people I have spoken to about hosting issue the more I hear of difficulties hosts have trying to resolve. \nIf anyone is considering hosting, just realise and consider that you are on your own. I'm sure there have been success's with other hosts dealing with issues and that's great but my experience has been pretty difficult lengthy, frustrating and so have others....you've a great brand Airbnb, the notion of hosting is awesome, meeting different people is pretty great and I have...Until something goes wrong, then, it removes the positive aspects to all of this.",1468282856757358_1888077084777931,11,9,9

I just had a guest who when I was  out of town helped herself to my unopened brand new creamer that I was saving. I feel like she said pay for me to get a new one. She didn't even ask she just helped herself. Should I mention this in her review? Not only that but she left her curling on in the bathroom which would cause a fire. I feel like when the parents are gone the children will play and that when you turn your back you can't trust certain guests. She is already getting a great deal and to me you never take without asking permission especially in a strangers house. She is old enough to know better. I hate when you give a guest an inch and they take a mile. Not to mention I left her two other creamers to use and this one was expensive. And it's half gone. She didn't even ask she just helped herself. I want to charge for her since it's half gone and she had other choices. Should I mention this in her review?

I have recently been working on a business in the Airbnb space with a launch date not too far away. However, prior to launching I have been asking Airbnb Hosts for their feedback.\n\nI have met several Melbourne based Hosts for coffee over the past few weeks to discuss my idea and to gauge their feedback. The people I am reaching out to are Hosts who I believe seem dedicated to hosting and who understand what it takes to provide a great guest experience.\n\nThe product and service I am launching is a convenient solution to improve the hosting experience. It will empower Hosts to enhance guest experience through a unique offering – a subscription based service which provides mini ‘hotel essentials’ for you to provide your guests.\n\nI have put together a short 2-3 minute survey and would love if you could help me out by completing it. All Hosts who complete the survey will get their first month of Airbnb Host Essentials on me and also go into the draw to win a $200AUD pre-paid Visa card!\n\nHost link:  https://goo.gl/forms/BoC8qhL7S8DBpHoA3 \n\nFeel free to share the link with your Airbnb Host network – the more feedback we get, the better we can make the service for Airbnb Hosts (and of course, your guests)!\n\nIf you would like to chat with me about what I’ve been up to, please reach out and contact me. I would love your feedback!\n\nThis survey is for Australian Hosts only.\n\nI hope you have a great day! \n\nAnna",1468282856757358_1884418245143815,11,9,9

I have been an active AirBnB member for about 5 years, and have been a hist for 4 months.  I have unfortunately had to make two cancellations on my listing, before I sorted out my calendar management.  All of my reviews personally and of my listing have been excellent. I made my second cancellation (of a one-night booking in August 2017) a few days ago.  AirBnB gave me warnings and charged me $50.  Fair enough.  I woke in the middle of last night to see another booking request.  When I responded I found that my listing had been de-activated.  THIS IS WHERE THINGS GET STRANGE.  I followed the link to reactivate my listing only to find that my listing has been set back to draft mode, with no calendar, pricing, rules etc.  Even the photos need to be re-done.  All of my reservations are gone, as are all of my reviews of my listing and of me personally.  This is very alarming, since I have people booked in coming weeks and months who have planned family holidays to my apartment in Croatia.  I sent an email from the Help Center.  When I received the helpdesk confirmation email it was in Italian!  I sent another email asking why my response was in Italian.  The response to that was in Italian too.  There is no way I have changed my language in my settings recently, but I looked and sure enough it was set to Italian.  I changed back to English. Can anyone shine any light on my issue??

I've been researching air BNB hosting- and found out today my small city doesn't allow air BNB- falls under the boarding house and short term rental ban.  Has anyone advice and help they can give me? I'm going to email the city planner to discuss options... as I don't feel that the air BNB format is the same as the types that aren't allowed.  It could be they allow some types but not all?  Am thinking that entire house rentals may pose issues with neighbors ... but apartments and rooms, should not affect neighbors.  Is it possible to limit what can be offered in a particular area?  \n\nOur city has a very nice water park and adjacent camping. It's hard to get IN the campsite bc of permanent campers- yet our city does not allow trailer parks within the city limits-- but there are people who have lived in the campground for five years without moving their trailer.. and some actually have storage buildings on the lots!  So!  If they can bend those regulations-- seems that air BNB fits too!  \n\nPlus; it's my understanding that we pay hotel or lodging tax ?

You can do an area search to verify this.\n\nAlso, we've read, and now personally witnessed examples of guests making false claims about the state of your property to earn discounts or refunds.

PLEASE HELP ME !!! PLEASEHELP ME !!!  \n\nHi, I'm Francesco 28 yars old from Italy. I am writing here in Italian, I hope some people, working within the Airbnb group, can help me to solve the problems I have, without getting any response from the customer service.\n\nSalve, mi chiamo Francesco italiano viaggio spesso in giro per il mondo e ho il moi appartamento a Parigi, dove ormai sono residente da anni. \n\nAnni fa, quando il sito era agli inizi avevo creato un conto e ho anche affittato un appartamento, dopodiché non ho più utilizzato il sito finché non ho avuto ancora bisogno, solamente che questa volta ho effuato l'accesso con facebook ed é stato all'ora che il sistema ha bloccato il moi conto, perché la mail associata al moi conto facebook era diversa da quella che avevo utilizzato quando ho fatto l'iscrizione su airbnb. Ho cercato di risolvere il problema da solo eliminando i due acxount creati. Non é cambiato nulla, per cui ho cominciato un lunghissimo percorso con il servizio clienti Airbnb Italia ed Airbnb France ( paese in cui risiedo) per cercare di risolvere il problema. Alla fine dopo tanto tempo mi sono arreso perché il caso era stato chiuso e gli account creati a moi nome erano stati eliminati. Da allora sono passati anni, ho cambiato il documento perché mi era scaduto, numero di telefono, ho creato un conto paypal, ed anche banca.\n\nLo scorso febbraio ho cambiato appartamento ed adesso vivo in uno dei luoghi più desiderati della capitale francese, a soli 100 mt dalla cattedrale Notre dame e, dato che ho ricominciato a viaggiare tanto, ho pensato di poter essere accettato nella grande famiglia Airbnb\n\nIl tempo di sistemare il moi appartamento, comprando dei mobili, imbiancare e fare alcuni lavori che ho effettuato il moi primo viaggio con un amico a Colonia. L'appartamento che avevamo trovato era stato grazie ad un passaparola e alla fine il nostro soggiorno in Germania é stato un vero disastro perché la persona che doveva ospitari ci é incassato i soldi ed é sparito. \n\nRitornato a Parigi, e spinto dai tanti amici sempre in viaggio e da tanti altri che affittano i propi appartamenti, ho deciso di sfruttare al meglio le mie risorse... un appartamento nel cuore di Parigi mi da la possibilità di affittarlo sempre e guadagnando tanto, mentre con i soldi dai possibili guadagni potevo spenderli per pagarmi gli altri soggiorni che comunque farei lo stesso.\n\nA fine aprile, ho creato un conto Airbnb direttamente con il moi facebook e la mai associata, ho effettuato tutte le procedure di sicurezza automatiche, ho creato un annuncio e l'ho pubblicato. Non avevo nessuna richiesta, ma non mi ero preoccupato, finché non ho iniziato a scrivere ad alcuni host per sapere se avevano delle disponibilità in previsione di un viaggio a Ginevra ed un altro, in gruppo, previsto a Madrid. Il sito mi diceva che non potevo contattare gli host e che dovevo chiamare il servizio assistenza clienti per il problema. Bene, li chiamai tempestivamente e fu aperto un caso da parte di un altro operatore, solo il 9 maggio, che mi ha garantito che avrebbe portato in tempi brevi alla risoluzione del problema. Da allora chiamo tutti i giorni sia in Italia che in Francia per sapere lo stato di avanzamento della procedura di verifica in corso. \nPer accellerare e facilitare tutto, visto che ogni volta dovevo passare delle ore al telefono con operatori che ogni volta cambiavano, ho inviato una mail dove spiegavo bene tutto, inviano anche tutti i documenti in mio possesso ( passaporto, carta d'identità, patente, carta di credito, bollette del cosumo energetico e del telefono intestate a moi nome e con il mio indirizzo, tessera sanitaria italiana, tessera sanitaria francese, ect ect....), ho anche contattato il sito per richiedere il sevizio di un fotografo che viene offerto gratuitamente, che possa autenticare il moi annuncio e con delle belle foto che possano mettere in risalto il mio appartamento che sto mettendo in affitto su Airbnb.\nAllo stesso, tempo ho creato altri annunci su altri siti concorrenti ad Airbnb, ma che non hanno lo stesso peso nel mondo, ed ho inviato i link al servizio assistenza clienti per fare vedere che in nessun altro sito ho riscontrato gli stessi problemi e che realmente il moi appartamento é messso in locazione. \n\n Da allora, in totale i casi aperti e inoltrati al dipartimento per le verifiche e la sicurezza Airbnb sono ben 3. Ma risultano essere stati « parcheggiati » perché ogni volta che chiamo il servizio clienti, qualsiasi operatore mi dice che non puo' fare altro che mettere la pratica al massimo stato di urgenza ed ogni volta che richiamo il nulovo operatore con cui parlo mi ridice la stessa cosa e, che non puo' dirmi con esattezza quando il problema sara preso in considerazione ed esaminato, per cui mi invita a ricontattare il servizio clienti per conoscere lo stato di avanzamento della pratica. \nNessuno, é stato in grado di risolvere il mio problema a distanza di tempo, o meglio nessuno a preso realmente il mio caso nelle mani perché ogni volta che un operatore telefonico del servizio clienti esegue la normale procedura, suppongo che essa venga automaticamente bloccata dal sistema e, la mia pratica non viene nemmeno presa in considerazione da parte del dipartimento di verifica del sito Airbnb.    \nIl penultimo, operatore mi ha invitato a non far parte della famiglia Airbnb perché questa multinazionale é privata e libera di applicate le politiche che vuole per accettare o meno sia host che viaggiatori o entrambi a fare parte di questa grande famiglia. E, che potevo benissimo continuare ad utilizzare le piattaforme concorrenziali ad Airbnb, qualora quest'ultima non avrebbe soddisfatto le mie esigenze. Di fatti propio ieri ho effettuato una prenotazione per me ad altri 4 ragazzi sul sito Booking, ho inviato copia della conferma di avveuta prenotazione ad Airbnb per mostrare l'effettiva veridicità di quanto dica ogni qualvolta sia entrato in contatto con l'assistenza Airbnb.\nL'ultimo operatore con il quale ho parlato, mi ha inviatato a scrivere nella pagina facebook di Airbnb, al fine di poter trovare qualcuno che ricopra una funzione al di sopra di quella di un operatore telefonico, che prenda realmente in carico l'esaminazione del caso e porti ad una risoluzione dello stesso. Per tanto, invito la persona/e che leggeranno questo messaggio a contattarmi e consentirmi di poter spendere i miei soldi con Voi e di guadagnarne altrettanti.\nGrazie, per l'attenzione\nCordialmente Francesco",1468282856757358_1867807136804926,16,11,11

Once she left I found flooding and sewage backup in my washroom and another area.  I found out my female guest put down my toilet over 25 tampons and other items over the period of 5 days.  As you know, they don't go there.  Well, that caused a backup and then a semi flood in my unit.  I called an emergency plumber which removed the tampons which cost me $600 for 3.5 hours of Sunday emergency work.   Let's not even talk about damage below my hardwood.  I had to cancel the next guest and I sent photos to Airbnb as they acknowledged the issue and canceled without penalty for me (lost another $120). I then submitted a claim, with the pictures of the damage, the plumber's invoice which clearly stated that the tampons caused the damage, and even the guest herself admitted on record she did flush them all.  It took Airbnb almost 2 months of no replies to come back to me and say they will not support my claim nor give any of the damage deposit back.  They sent a lackluster email stated I had several guests after the said female left (All the guest were Males) and stated they cannot associate the damage (because it took 10 days from the invoice to go to my property manager then to me) to the female guest even though the plumbing emergency invoice if from the same day she left and that I had to cancel the next guest because of this issue.  Airbnb then said they will not speak about this matter anymore.  It took them 2 months (2months!!!) to come back to me with this response.  I have all the communication with Airbnb, even a recorded phone call with another service person who stated this shouldn't be my issue.  I highly warm you guys the issues of damage and the path to getting money for it.  Image dealing with Airbnb for issues worth thousands. I will stop being a host after this horrible customer service journey.",1468282856757358_1866952700223703,16,11,11

I find they take 3 working days normally.  I'm still astounded in this day of technology that payments take so long....they should be nearly instantaneous and even on weekends and holidays.  My theory has been for a long time that this is just banks (and now airbnb) putting money on the short term money market to earn more.  There's no excuse now for the time delay.  So last night I set up a couple of new accounts for payout methods.  Guess what....the $0.01 transfer is my accounts today.  Less than 24 hours.  Airbnb have had our money from the time of booking confirmation ad will be earning them interest and income in that time.

This is completely unacceptable to us. We have filled out the resolution form TWICE today and your system has crashed both times. We feel we should be a couple of steps further in the process considering we started this the day the guest left on March 16th. We have been calling since check out day to resolve this issue. And truly feel that we are getting the runaround from your department. Per the recommendation of your Air bnb customer service rep we were advised on March 16 to NOT fill out the resolution form nor to contact the guest directly for 2 reasons: the damage is estimated way over the security deposit amount and they do not speak English. When they were here we had to use Google Translate for every single question and conversation. We have been told that their guest security deposit is only $1,000 and will not come anywhere close to reimbursing us for the damages we have incurred, we are looking at around $19,000 in damages and lost rental income. We have already spoken to someone in detail about the Host Guarantee and was assured that when I forwarded my pictures and videos that would be sufficient enough to get the ball rolling.  When we spoke with Benjamin M. on the phone he assured us that the host guarantee would already be in process. I have a painters bill for $5,500 that needs to be paid I have a mold specialist for about $450.00 that have been waiting to be paid for a week. \n All of my household items that were damaged need to be replaced. We have sent that detailed list to you. We are also losing valuable renting time for our high season of Spring Break (march/april)  we are turning away guests for $7,000. this month due to the excessive damage and not being able to rent. Please give us a call ASAP.  We stated earlier we have been trying to contact your company since March 16th. You can pull up our case and see how many times we have contacted Air BnB for a resolution. We have been very patient. \nKindly, Gene and Lainie Carswell",1468282856757358_1847911555461151,16,11,11

Quand les gens réservent pour plus de 7 jours, le prix par nuit descend à $21 la nuit au lieu de $350 si bien que nous avons reçu beaucoup de réservations sur une période de 10 jours à $21 par jour et que nous avons du refuser. Ce problème endommage énormément notre côte Airbnb. \nNous avons contacter a plusieurs reprises Airbnb pour régler le problème et pour l’instant il semble que Airbnb reste indifférent a notre problème et ne semble pas motiver a trouver une solution. Nous avons beaucoup investi pour atteindre la côte Superhost et pour l’instant il semble que cela a été fait en vain.\nNous voulons attirer l’attention de Airbnb pour qu’il daigne régler notre problème et pour l’instant cela a été sans succès.\nMerci de votre attention et surtout soyez attentif  \n\nDear Airbnb guests,\nLearn about our problem.\nFor 2 weeks, we can no longer display our accommodation on Airbnb due to a bug on the platform on our account.

This problem does serious damages to our Airbnb coast.\nWe have repeatedly contacted Airbnb, to solve the problem and for now it seems that, Airbnb, remains indifferent to our problem and does not seem to motivate to find a solution. We have invested a lot to reach the Superhost coast and for now it seems that it was done in vain.\nWe want to draw the attention of Airbnb so that it deigns to solve our problem and for the moment this has been unsuccessful.\nThank you for your attention and above all be attentive",1468282856757358_1834731230112517,16,11,11

I had water damages to a wood floor   Immediately had Garbage disposal  replaced (the culprit) looked into Host Guarantee site saw it says attach Bill and Documentation. I put fans into the home to assist with drying the floors. after a week the floors buckled. Decided this can not be over looked but had to contact contractor a second time.                                                                                          I was advised by contractor to fully assess the damage  on hardwoods it will need to totally dry-out an additional week, floor may continue to revile water damages as it drys out. Sure enough it Buckled more. this took time!!  I took Bids and went with the most cost effective route,  replacing a partial area at a refraction of what it would cost to make flooring back to  it pre-damage state                  Unfortunately doing the right process for Flooring and Bids I missed the window for proper claim of 14 days (it took longer for damage to revile and submit billing. \n\nHere is  the part that sucks \nI paid Immediately for Garbage disposal replacement (I was going to eat it without claim it was under $1000)  it was only when damage to flooring got worse than a light sand that i reached out for the Guarantee. I feel taken advantage of due to this time frame Loop Hole devised by the Host Guarantee I think they knew full well that bigger issues where a host will file a claim will take longer to bid repair  or replace and that it certifiably takes ore than 14 days.  This is a feeling of being taken advantage of.

It got horribly destroyed, the visitors broke our bed, threw plates and hand-crafted decoration out of the window, stole our camera, wrote on our walls and many small things (a cooking pot, our trash can, a clothing rag, a poster, a lampion...) got damaged or missing. They had a look in all of our personal belongings and even found a credit card and used it to open two Paypal accounts. We had a damage of more than 700 Euros and much more personal time and value was wasted. \nNow the Airbnb insurance is giving us back only 185 Euros. Why that little? Because we didn’t keep the receipts for plates and trash cans… No body does! We had photos/videos of our apartment and were able to prove the damage. \n\nThe lesson we learned from this experience, is that you should never rent your apartment on airbnb, unless you kept the receipts of all the items you own. So you people out there with furniture and decoration, collected with love at antique at artisanal markets (who ever asked for a recipe there?), be prepared that you will we not get reimbursed when something breaks or gets stolen.\n\nWe will never rent out again our rooms or apartments with Airbnb. We are shocked that you don’t take care of your clients. We talked to many friends and family members and they were shocked as well. By not taking care of your clients, you are loosing them!\n\nGet your insurance policy straight, dear Airbnb.\n\nRegards,\nMiriam and Nele",1468282856757358_1825351994383774,16,11,2

Based on the HGTV shows people want to experience them! They attain a hire income stream because of the desire for people to try them. Plus if they like them you can receive a commission on the sales that we handle.The shell is 300 sq st and costs $15,000.  You have to build out. They DO NOT have wheels but can be moved easily by shed manufacturers.  If interested PM us. Thank you.   PS: We are based in Florida so best to be close.

My husband and I have stayed in numerous hotels and B&Bs with very little hassle until I tried Airbnb. I did manage to upload a picture of my driving licence which was deemed insufficient evidence that I am who I say I am. There was no way I could formally cancel my request so I have inconvenienced the hosts and wasted a great deal of time. Right from the start I have been amazed that a simple thing like mentioning the precise location - even within a few miles - would be very helpful and time/saving when searching for a place to stay but you have to open each post to get an even approximate idea of its location. The website is so inferior to other methods of searching for accommodation. After reading some hosts' remarks I'm amazed anyone bothers. I certainly won't until it improves. \nRosemary",1468282856757358_1822285348023772,4,11,1

This lively neighborhood not only serves as the cultural center of Baltimore but as the home to a diverse group of residents and businesses. College students who walk to class and professionals who work here, downtown, or as far away as Washington and New York are just some of the people who take advantage of Mt. Vernon's convenient location. Singles and empty nesters who seek to avoid the monotony of the suburbs, enjoy a wide array of art, entertainment, and services just steps from their front door. Living spaces include single family Victorian row homes, carriage houses, condominiums, apartments in row homes, and several high-rises.\n\nHistory Mt. Vernon acquired its land and name during the 19th century when John Eager Howard and his heirs donated the highest point in Baltimore to become the site for the first memorial to George Washington. The site of the Washington Monument in Mt. Vernon Square is generally regarded as one of the most beautiful urban sites in the world. Between 1800 and 1900 Mt. Vernon was at the center of Baltimore's transformation from an insignificant harbor city to a place of prominence and wealth. This was the time when fortunes were made and great philanthropies bestowed. During the neighborhood's early history, wealthy residents including Henry and William Walters, Robert Garrett, A.S. Abell, and Theodore Marburg commissioned well-known architects such as Niernsee & Neilson, Stanford White, John Russell Pope, and Robert Mills to build the grand buildings and monuments that still grace the neighborhood.\n\nLinda Orlomoski's photo is of the Brexton's spiral staircase.\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/mouseski/4881572056/",126753367445648_200189173457257,0,0,0

His Merrifield project may not be happening, but that doesn't mean Jeff Black isn't keeping up his empire-builder status. The restaurateur (also an investor in Victor Albisu's upcoming Del Campo) now has his sights set on Takoma Park.\n\nTom Sietsema reports that Black will open a still-unnamed restaurant at 6937-6939 Laurel Ave. Details are pretty slim, but here's what he says:\n\n· The American restaurant will include a dining room, two drinking locations, a patio, live entertainment and a raw bar.\n\n· Black Restaurant Group chef Danny Wells, a Takoma Park native, will head up the kitchen.\n\n· There will be plenty of vegetarian options, which should go over well in the People's Republic of Takoma Park, as it's often jokingly called.\n\n· GTM Architects is doing the design.\n\n· Expect a 2013 fall opening.\n\nTakoma Park is seeing more and more young families move there, and the neighborhood lacks chef driven restaurants, so it'll be interesting to see if other restaurateurs follow in Black's footsteps.\n\nhttp://dc.eater.com/archives/2013/01/03/jeff-black-opening-american-restaurant-in-takoma-park.php",126753367445648_319962008103529,0,0,0

The collection's diverse array of artists helps capture the sociopolitical realities, local architecture, and startling landscapes of 20th century Mexico through a patently American lens.\n\nThe accompanying exhibit Visions of Mexico: The Photography of Hugo Brehme presents 40 works from Hugo Brehme on loan from the Throckmorton Gallery in New York City. A German émigré and popular postcard photographer, Brehme is perhaps best known for his hand-colored vintage photographs, which capture a Mexico as vibrant as it is timeless. Brehme's 20th century Mexico provides thoughtful contrast for La Frontera, a work-in-progress by NYC-based photographer Stefan Falke that chronicles modern-day artists along the US-Mexico border.\n\nhttp://www.instituteofmexicodc.org/luces.php",126753367445648_477034032331705,0,0,0

A master of caricature and satire, Daumier so lampooned King Louis-Philippe that the artist was charged with sedition and imprisoned for six months in 1832. Pulitzer Prize-winning political cartoonist Oliphant—whose work has been exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery and the Library of Congress and published in the New Yorker, the New York Times, and the Washington Post—had a deep and longstanding admiration of Daumier’s work. During a retrospective at the Phillips in 2000, Oliphant produced a lithograph inspired by the exhibition and proclaimed in his Washington Post review of the show, “Monsieur Daumier, you certainly are a humbler.”\n\nhttp://www.phillipscollection.org/exhibitions/2012-09-06-exhibition-daumier-oliphant.aspx",126753367445648_554323017911180,0,0,0

How she felt about other things in her life is harder to say. After becoming the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, she was rarely out of public view. In the many images of her after 1928, she appears as the epitome of grace and poise.
